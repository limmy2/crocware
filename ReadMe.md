the crocware flipper zero firmware is a firmware that is a fork of roguemaster firmware. I am making this firmware to make the roguemaster firmware better by adding helpful apps that roguemaster does not have, i am adding usefull files for nfc, bad usb, sub ghz, infared and many other files for other applications. At first this firmware was going to be named after my dog but out of no where i just thought of crocware so i chose that instead. You can see that
